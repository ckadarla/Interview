# Azure 5 R’s Migration Model

The **Azure 5 R’s Migration Model** is a framework to evaluate and plan the migration of on-premises workloads to Microsoft Azure. It helps organizations select the most appropriate strategy based on business goals, technical fit, and modernization needs.

---

## 1. Rehost (Lift and Shift)

- **Definition**: Move applications to Azure without changes.
- **When to Use**:
  - Need a quick migration.
  - Compatible with Azure VMs.
- **Tools**:
  - Azure Migrate
  - Azure Site Recovery
- **Pros**:
  - Fastest migration path.
  - Minimal risk.
- **Cons**:
  - Doesn't leverage cloud-native features.
  - Higher long-term operational cost.

---

## 2. Refactor (Repackage / Lift, Tinker, and Shift)

- **Definition**: Minor changes to apps (e.g., config updates, containerization) to run on Azure.
- **When to Use**:
  - Want to migrate to PaaS or containers.
- **Tools**:
  - Azure App Service
  - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
  - Azure Container Apps
- **Pros**:
  - Better use of cloud capabilities.
  - Easier to manage than VMs.
- **Cons**:
  - Some code/config changes required.
  - More complex than rehost.

---

## 3. Rearchitect

- **Definition**: Modify app architecture for scalability, resilience, and cloud-native design.
- **When to Use**:
  - Existing architecture isn’t scalable or modern.
- **Tools**:
  - Azure Functions
  - Azure Logic Apps
  - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
  - Azure Event Grid / Service Bus
- **Pros**:
  - Cloud-native architecture benefits.
  - Supports microservices.
- **Cons**:
  - Time-consuming and costly.
  - Requires deeper expertise.

---

## 4. Rebuild (Redesign / Rewrite)

- **Definition**: Rebuild the app from scratch using cloud-native technologies.
- **When to Use**:
  - Legacy app is outdated or doesn’t meet needs.
- **Tools**:
  - Azure SQL
  - Cosmos DB
  - Azure Functions
- **Pros**:
  - Maximum cloud benefits.
  - Opportunity for modern business needs.
- **Cons**:
  - High cost and effort.
  - Potentially risky if mismanaged.

---

## 5. Replace (Drop and Shop)

- **Definition**: Replace app with SaaS solution.
- **When to Use**:
  - SaaS product satisfies the business requirement.
- **Examples**:
  - Dynamics 365 (ERP)
  - Microsoft 365 (Email, Collaboration)
- **Pros**:
  - Rapid deployment.
  - Low operational burden.
- **Cons**:
  - Limited customization.
  - Vendor lock-in possible.

## Summary Table

| Strategy    | Code Changes | Time to Migrate | Cloud-Native Benefits | Use Case                                |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Rehost      | None         | Fast             | Low                    | Quick migration, legacy apps            |
| Refactor    | Minimal      | Moderate         | Moderate               | PaaS migration, minor tweaks            |
| Rearchitect | Moderate     | Longer           | High                   | Microservices, scalable design          |
| Rebuild     | Full rewrite | Longest          | Very High              | Legacy apps need modernization          |
| Replace     | None         | Varies           | Depends on SaaS        | When off-the-shelf SaaS is viable       |
