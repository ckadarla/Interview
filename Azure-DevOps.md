Here's a **basic Azure DevOps YAML pipeline structure** to get you started. This example outlines a typical CI workflow that builds and tests a simple app:

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
      - develop

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

variables:
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'
  artifactName: 'drop'

stages:
  - stage: Build
    displayName: 'Build Stage'
    jobs:
      - job: BuildJob
        displayName: 'Build Job'
        steps:
          - task: UseDotNet@2
            inputs:
              packageType: 'sdk'
              version: '7.x.x'  # Change to your desired .NET version
              installationPath: $(Agent.ToolsDirectory)/dotnet

          - script: |
              dotnet build --configuration $(buildConfiguration)
            displayName: 'Dotnet Build'

          - script: |
              dotnet test --configuration $(buildConfiguration)
            displayName: 'Run Tests'

          - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
            inputs:
              PathtoPublish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
              ArtifactName: '$(artifactName)'
              publishLocation: 'Container'
```

| `trigger`       | Defines which branches trigger the pipeline                             |
| `pool`          | Specifies the agent (Microsoft-hosted or self-hosted)                   |
| `variables`     | Defines variables you can reuse across the pipeline                     |
| `stages`        | Breaks the pipeline into logical phases (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy)     |
| `jobs`          | Inside each stage, defines one or more jobs (units of work)             |
| `steps`         | Tasks or scripts that run in sequence within a job                      |

Want to add **deployment**, **multi-stage pipelines**, or **container build and push**? Let me know and I can extend this for your use case.
