## CI/CD with Azure DevOps

**Q1. What are the key benefits of using YAML pipelines over Classic in Azure DevOps?**  
**A:** YAML pipelines are version-controlled, reusable, and portable. They support CI/CD as code and enable better collaboration and traceability.

**Q2. How do you trigger a pipeline on branch push or pull request in YAML?**  
```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main

pr:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
```

**Q3. How do you pass variables between pipeline stages in Azure DevOps YAML?**  
**A:** Use `output variables`. Example:
```yaml
- task: Bash@3
  name: SetVar
  script: echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=myVar;isOutput=true]Hello"
```

**Q4. How do you secure secrets in Azure DevOps pipelines?**  
**A:** Use variable groups linked to Azure Key Vault, mark secrets as sensitive, and avoid echoing them.

**Q5. How do you implement a multi-stage deployment pipeline in Azure DevOps YAML?**  
**A:** Define stages like `build`, `deploy-dev`, `deploy-prod`. Use approvals and conditions between them.

## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

**Q6. What are the key components of AKS architecture?**  
**A:** Control plane (managed by Azure), node pools, kubelet, kube-proxy, Container Runtime (e.g., containerd).

**Q7. How do you deploy an application to AKS?**  
**A:** Use `kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml` or `helm install`, post-authentication via `az aks get-credentials`.

**Q8. How do you expose services externally in AKS?**  
**A:** Use `LoadBalancer` service type or Ingress controller (NGINX, Application Gateway).

**Q9. How do you configure RBAC in AKS?**  
**A:** Use `Role`, `ClusterRole`, `RoleBinding`, and `ClusterRoleBinding`. Integrate with Azure AD for secure auth.

**Q10. How do you perform node pool scaling in AKS?**  
**A:** Use `az aks nodepool scale` or configure autoscaler in cluster settings.

## Infrastructure as Code (Terraform / Bicep / ARM)

**Q11. What are the advantages of Bicep over ARM templates?**  
**A:** Bicep is cleaner, easier to read, modular, and supports automatic conversion to ARM JSON.

**Q12. How do you manage environments in Terraform?**  
**A:** Use workspaces, separate variable files, or modules with dynamic inputs.

**Q13. How do you provision an AKS cluster using Terraform?**  
**A:** Use `azurerm_kubernetes_cluster` resource. Define node pools, identity, and network config.

**Q14. What is the use of `depends_on` in Terraform?**  
**A:** Ensures resources are created in a specific order when dependencies aren't automatically inferred.

**Q15. How do you pass secrets or sensitive data in Terraform securely?**  
**A:** Use `sensitive = true`, environment variables, or integrate with Key Vault.

---

## Kubernetes Resources & Helm

**Q16. What is a Helm chart and how is it structured?**  
**A:** A Helm chart is a package with templated Kubernetes YAML files. It has folders like `templates/`, `values.yaml`, and `Chart.yaml`.

**Q17. How do you override Helm chart values during install?**  
```bash
helm install myapp ./mychart -f custom-values.yaml
```

**Q18. How do you roll back a Helm release?**  
```bash
helm rollback <release-name> <revision>
```

**Q19. What is a ConfigMap and when do you use it?**  
**A:** A ConfigMap stores non-sensitive configuration as key-value pairs. Use it for app settings, env variables, etc.

**Q20. How does a Kubernetes Deployment differ from a StatefulSet?**  
**A:** Deployment is for stateless apps; StatefulSet is for apps that need stable identity, like databases.

---

## Monitoring & Observability

**Q21. How do you monitor AKS with Azure Monitor?**  
**A:** Enable Container Insights, use metrics/alerts in Azure Monitor, and integrate with Log Analytics.

**Q22. How does Prometheus work in Kubernetes?**  
**A:** It scrapes `/metrics` endpoints via service discovery. Deployed via Helm or Operator in AKS.

**Q23. What is Log Analytics Workspace used for?**  
**A:** It aggregates logs from Azure services and resources. Used in conjunction with Azure Monitor.

**Q24. How do you set up alerts in Azure Monitor?**  
**A:** Create metric/log-based alerts using action groups and thresholds for metrics (CPU, memory, etc.)

**Q25. How can you visualize metrics in Grafana for AKS?**  
**A:** Use Azure Monitor or Prometheus data source. Configure dashboards for custom visualization.

## Security & Secrets Management

**Q26. How do you store and retrieve secrets in Azure Key Vault?**  
**A:** Store via Azure CLI/Portal. Access using SDKs, `az keyvault secret show`, or pipeline variable groups.

**Q27. How do you integrate Key Vault with Azure DevOps pipelines?**  
**A:** Link a variable group to Key Vault in Library. Ensure access policies allow pipeline identity.

**Q28. How do you use Kubernetes secrets securely?**  
**A:** Use base64-encoded values, encrypt at rest, and access via environment variables or volume mounts.

**Q29. What is pod security context?**  
**A:** Defines privilege settings for pods/containersâ€”like running as non-root, readOnlyRootFilesystem.

**Q30. How do you restrict external traffic in AKS?**  
**A:** Use Network Policies, disable public IPs, use Private AKS, and restrict Ingress with WAF.

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

**Q31. How do you troubleshoot a failing Kubernetes pod?**  
**A:** Use `kubectl describe pod`, `kubectl logs`, and check events for error details.

**Q32. What steps do you take when a YAML deployment fails?**  
**A:** Validate syntax (`kubectl apply --dry-run=client`), check resource quotas, logs, and error events.

**Q33. How do you diagnose Azure DevOps pipeline failures?**  
**A:** Examine logs, retry failed tasks, enable debug mode, use diagnostic tasks like `System.Debug`.

**Q34. What are readiness and liveness probes in Kubernetes?**  
**A:**
