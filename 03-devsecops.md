## üîπ Technical Interview Questions & Answers

### 1. **How would you implement DevSecOps in a hybrid AWS‚ÄìAzure environment?**

**Answer:**
I‚Äôd start with IaC-driven provisioning using Terraform for consistency across AWS and Azure. Then I‚Äôd integrate security at each stage:

* **Pre-deployment:** Policy-as-code (OPA, Sentinel, or Azure Policy) to enforce guardrails.
* **CI/CD:** Static code analysis (SonarQube, Checkov) + secret scanning (TruffleHog, GitHub Advanced Security).
* **Runtime:** Implement vulnerability scanning (Wiz, Defender for Cloud), enforce IAM least privilege, enable logging with CloudTrail/CloudWatch and Azure Monitor.
* **Post-deployment:** Continuous compliance checks and automated remediation for drift.

---

### 2. **How do you use Terraform to enforce security guardrails?**

**Answer:**

* Create reusable **Terraform modules** that enforce defaults (e.g., encrypted S3 buckets, HTTPS-only load balancers).
* Apply **Terraform Sentinel/OPA policies** to block misconfigurations.
* Store state securely in Terraform Cloud or remote backends with encryption.
* Use **version-controlled IaC** and PR-based reviews to ensure compliance before deployment.

---

### 3. **What IAM guardrails would you enforce in AWS and Azure?**

**Answer:**

* **AWS:** SCPs via AWS Organizations, enforce MFA, disable root access, use IAM roles instead of long-term keys, restrict wildcard `*` permissions.
* **Azure:** Use Azure AD Conditional Access, enforce RBAC, restrict subscription-level owner roles, integrate Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for just-in-time access.
* Both: Principle of Least Privilege, continuous monitoring of permission creep, periodic access reviews.

---

### 4. **How have you worked with Wiz in cloud security posture management?**

**Answer:**

* Integrated Wiz with AWS and Azure accounts to continuously scan for misconfigurations, exposed secrets, and unpatched vulnerabilities.
* Used Wiz dashboards to prioritize risks based on context (e.g., vulnerability + exposed to internet).
* Automated remediation workflows via Terraform or Azure Automation for recurring issues.
* Helped security teams create custom policies to align with compliance frameworks (NIST, CIS, SOC2).

---

### 5. **How do you handle vulnerability management in cloud environments?**

---

### 9. **How do you provide technical guidance and knowledge transfer to team members?**

**Answer:**

* Document Terraform modules, security standards, and runbooks in Confluence/Wiki.
* Conduct brown-bag sessions and hands-on workshops.
* Pair programming and code reviews to upskill juniors.
* Create self-service pipelines so teams adopt security by default.

---

### 10. **Give an example of a time when you detected and remediated a serious vulnerability.**
