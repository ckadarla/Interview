|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **Isolation**               | Each VNet is isolated from other VNets and networks by default. |
| **Subnets**                 | VNets can be divided into subnets to organize and secure resources. |
| **Private IPs**             | Resources within a VNet communicate using private IP addresses. |
| **Routing**                 | Azure provides default routing and supports custom route tables. |
| **Network Security Groups** | NSGs allow or deny traffic to/from resources based on security rules. |
| **Service Endpoints**       | Securely connect to Azure services (e.g., Azure SQL, Storage) using the VNet. |
| **Private Link**            | Provides private access to PaaS services over your VNet. |
| **VNet Peering**            | Connect VNets across regions or subscriptions with high-speed links. |
