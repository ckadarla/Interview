Alright ‚Äî here‚Äôs an **extended set of Q\&A** focusing on **scenario-based, troubleshooting, and deep-dive** questions for your JD + resume alignment.

---

## **Advanced & Scenario-Based Q\&A**

### **11. How would you design a highly available EKS cluster for production workloads?**

**Answer:**
I‚Äôd provision an EKS cluster across at least 3 Availability Zones for HA. Worker nodes would be in multiple subnets (private for workloads, public for ingress). I‚Äôd enable cluster autoscaler, set up managed node groups, and integrate an ALB Ingress Controller for routing. For persistence, I‚Äôd use EBS or EFS depending on workloads. Security would include network policies, RBAC, IRSA for pods, and Secrets Manager for sensitive data. Monitoring via Prometheus + Grafana, and logging via Fluent Bit to CloudWatch.

---

### **12. How do you manage secrets in your pipelines?**

**Answer:**
I avoid hardcoding secrets ‚Äî instead, I integrate AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store with pipelines. For Kubernetes, I use sealed-secrets or external-secrets operator to inject secrets at runtime. Access is controlled via IAM roles, ensuring least privilege. For example, in one project, we replaced all plain Kubernetes secrets with sealed-secrets encrypted via KMS, reducing exposure risks.

---

### **13. If a pod in EKS is in `CrashLoopBackOff`, how do you troubleshoot?**

**Answer:**

1. `kubectl describe pod` ‚Üí check events & last exit code.
2. `kubectl logs` ‚Üí review application logs.
3. Check readiness/liveness probe configurations.
4. Validate image pull secrets & container registry access.
5. If OOMKilled, adjust `resources.requests/limits`.
6. If config-related, fix environment variables or ConfigMaps.
   I also check node conditions (`kubectl get nodes`) to ensure no resource pressure.

---

### **14. How would you implement GitOps in a multi-environment setup?**

**Answer:**
I‚Äôd maintain separate Git branches or directories for `dev`, `stage`, and `prod` manifests. Argo CD would be configured with an application per environment, each pointing to the respective path/branch. Sync policies would differ ‚Äî auto-sync for dev, manual approval for prod. Rollbacks would be handled via Argo CD‚Äôs revision history.

---

### **15. What‚Äôs your approach for disaster recovery in AWS?**

**Answer:**
For EKS workloads, I‚Äôd back up etcd snapshots (via Velero) and persistent volumes (EBS/EFS). For databases, I‚Äôd enable automated RDS snapshots and cross-region replication. S3 buckets would have versioning and replication enabled. Terraform state would be stored in S3 with cross-region replication for infra restore.

---

### **16. How do you optimize AWS costs for Kubernetes workloads?**

**Answer:**

* Use spot instances for non-critical workloads with mixed node groups.
* Apply right-sizing recommendations for EC2 and RDS.
* Schedule node scale-down during off-hours.
* Implement AWS Compute Savings Plans.
* In one project, I cut EKS costs by 35% using Karpenter for dynamic node provisioning.

---

### **17. If a Terraform apply fails halfway, what‚Äôs your next step?**

**Answer:**
First, I‚Äôd check the error logs to see if it‚Äôs a syntax error, API rate limit, or dependency issue. I‚Äôd run `terraform plan` again to see the drift, then either fix the code or use `terraform taint` on failed resources before re-applying. For state corruption, I‚Äôd lock and manually adjust the S3 state file with DynamoDB lock table.

---

### **18. How do you ensure container image security before deployment?**

**Answer:**

* Build images from minimal base images.
* Run vulnerability scans with Trivy/AquaSec.
* Sign images using Cosign.
* Store in a private registry (ECR) with lifecycle policies.
* At LTI, I enforced image scanning as a mandatory pipeline stage before pushing to ECR.

---

### **19. How do you handle Kubernetes config drift?**

**Answer:**
Using GitOps with Argo CD prevents drift ‚Äî any out-of-band changes trigger a ‚Äúdiff‚Äù alert. We can auto-sync or revert changes to match Git. For Terraform, I use drift detection via `terraform plan` in a scheduled pipeline.

---

### **20. Describe a time when you improved deployment reliability.**

**Answer:**
In one client‚Äôs banking application, deployments often failed due to schema mismatches. I introduced database migration checks in CI/CD, health probes for early failure detection, and pre-prod canary testing. This reduced deployment rollbacks by 60% and improved release confidence.

### **1. Tell me about your experience with AWS cloud infrastructure.**

**Answer:**
I have over a decade of hands-on AWS experience, provisioning and managing services like EC2, VPC, S3, RDS, EKS, Lambda, and SNS. I‚Äôve implemented these via both AWS CLI and Terraform, ensuring compliance with IAM policies, security groups, tagging standards, and cost optimization dashboards. For example, at LTI Mindtree, I provisioned multi-account AWS environments with Terraform/Terragrunt modules, integrated AWS KMS for encryption, and maintained cost visibility through AWS Cost Explorer and custom Grafana dashboards.

---

### **2. How have you managed Kubernetes deployments on EKS or equivalent?**

**Answer:**
I‚Äôve deployed and managed Kubernetes workloads on AWS EKS, Azure AKS, and GCP GKE. My experience covers authoring Helm charts, configuring ingress controllers like NGINX and ALB Ingress, implementing HPA/VPA for autoscaling, setting resource quotas, and defining liveness/readiness probes. In banking projects, I applied network policies and Pod Security Policies to meet strict compliance, integrated image scanning tools like Trivy and AquaSec into pipelines, and resolved CVEs before deployments.

---

### **3. How do you approach Infrastructure as Code (Terraform / Ansible / AWS SAM)?**

**Answer:**
I follow a modular IaC approach ‚Äî creating reusable Terraform modules with remote state management (S3 + DynamoDB locking), enforcing linting with TFLint, and ensuring drift detection via Terraform Cloud or Atlantis. I‚Äôve used Ansible for OS patching and configuration management, and AWS SAM for packaging and deploying serverless workloads like Lambda + API Gateway. For example, I automated EKS cluster provisioning with Terraform, Ansible-based node configuration, and integrated them into a CI/CD workflow.

---

### **4. What‚Äôs your experience with GitOps?**

**Answer:**
I‚Äôve implemented GitOps using Argo CD across multi-environment Kubernetes deployments. This included configuring automated and manual sync policies, setting rollback strategies, and applying RBAC for deployment control. At LTI, GitOps enabled zero-touch deployments for microservices ‚Äî developers committed changes to Git, Argo CD synced them to EKS, and security scans ran pre-deployment.

---

### **5. Can you explain a CI/CD pipeline you‚Äôve built?**

**Answer:**
I‚Äôve built pipelines using Jenkins, Bitbucket Pipelines, and Azure DevOps. A typical flow involved:

* Build & Unit Test ‚Üí Container Image Build (Kaniko or Docker) ‚Üí Image Scan (Trivy/AquaSec) ‚Üí Deploy to Dev via Argo CD ‚Üí Automated Functional Tests ‚Üí Manual Approval for Staging/Prod.
  At Excelra, I integrated Jira for issue tracking and Bitbucket for version control, ensuring traceability from commit to deployment.

---

### **6. How comfortable are you with scripting?**
