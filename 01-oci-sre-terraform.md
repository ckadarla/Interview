**Q:** How do you structure OCI compartments for a large enterprise or FS organization?
**A:**

* **Root compartment:** Minimal use; only for governance policies.
* **Sub-compartments by environment:** e.g., `dev`, `uat`, `prod`.
* **Further subdivision:** By business unit or application domain (e.g., Payments, Risk, Analytics).
* Enforce **least privilege policies** and integrate **IAM Federation** for user access.
* Use **OCI Tags** for cost tracking and compliance.

---

**Q:** How do you secure OCI environments?
**A:**

* Enforce IAM policies with least privilege.
* Use **Vault** for key and secret management.
* Configure **WAF** for application protection.
* Enable **Network Security Groups (NSG)** and private subnets.
* Monitor with **Cloud Guard** and **Security Zones**.
* Implement **Object Storage encryption** and **DB encryption (TDE)**.
* Regularly review **Audit logs** and integrate with SIEM tools.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **3. Terraform for OCI**

**Q:** How do you structure Terraform for OCI deployments?
**A:**

* **Root module** for high-level orchestration.
* **Child modules** for reusable components (network, compute, DB).
* Maintain **variables.tf**, **outputs.tf**, **providers.tf**.
* Store Terraform state in **OCI Object Storage (remote backend)**.
* Use **Terraform workspaces** or folder structure for different environments (dev, prod).
* Implement **version control (GitLab)** and **linting tools (TFLint, tfsec)** for quality.

---

**Q:** How do you handle Terraform state securely in OCI?
**A:**

* Store state file in **OCI Object Storage bucket** with versioning and encryption enabled.
* Restrict bucket access via **IAM policies**.
* Use **Terraform backend config** with minimal credentials (prefer dynamic group + instance principal).

---

**Q:** How do you handle drift detection and updates?
**A:**

* Use `terraform plan` in CI/CD to detect drift.
* Regularly run automated drift detection jobs.
* Enable manual approval step before applying changes.
* Maintain version locking in Terraform provider configurations.

---

## üß© **4. GitLab CI/CD**

**Q:** How do you use GitLab CI/CD for infrastructure automation?
**A:**

* Store Terraform code in GitLab repository.
* Define pipelines in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
* Stages: **init ‚Üí validate ‚Üí plan ‚Üí approval ‚Üí apply ‚Üí destroy**.
* Use **GitLab runners** with proper IAM permissions.
* Integrate with **Vault** or **GitLab secrets** for credentials.
* Trigger pipelines automatically on merge or tag events.

---

**Q:** How do you promote changes between environments?
**A:**

* Maintain separate branches or directories (`dev`, `uat`, `prod`).
* Validate and plan in lower envs before merging to higher ones.
* Use **manual approvals** in GitLab for production applies.
* Tag releases for traceability.

---

## üìä **5. Monitoring, Logging, and Incident Response**

**Q:** What monitoring stack do you use in OCI?
**A:**

* **OCI Monitoring:** Metrics for CPU, memory, disk, and network.
* **OCI Logging:** Centralized logs from compute, load balancer, functions.
* **Alarms:** Integrated with email, PagerDuty, or Slack.
* **Custom metrics:** Exposed via Prometheus exporters for applications.
* Use **Grafana** (connected to OCI metrics) for dashboards.

---

**Q:** How do you handle incidents and postmortems?
**A:**

* Integrate alerts with an incident management tool (PagerDuty/Jira).
* Follow **SRE golden signals**: latency, errors, traffic, saturation.
* Conduct **post-incident reviews** with RCA, corrective actions, and knowledge sharing.

---

## üîí **6. Security & Compliance (FS Domain Focus)**

**Q:** What special considerations are there for financial institutions?
**A:**

* **Data residency & encryption** (AES-256, TDE for DB).
* **Strict IAM and audit trails** (no shared credentials).
* **Network segmentation** (private endpoints, zero trust).
* **Regulatory compliance** (PCI DSS, ISO 27001, GDPR).
* **Change management**: Every infra change approved via CI/CD pipeline with audit trace.
* **Secrets management**: OCI Vault integration with GitLab CI/CD.

---

## üß∞ **7. Automation & Cloud-Native Practices**

**Q:** How do you automate app deployments?
**A:**

* Build Docker images via GitLab pipeline.
* Push to OCI Container Registry.
* Deploy using Terraform (for infra) and Helm/Kubernetes (for apps).
* Automate rollbacks on failure.

---

**Q:** How do you ensure high availability and scalability?
**A:**

* Use **Load Balancer** across multiple **Availability Domains (ADs)**.
* Enable **Autoscaling** for compute instances.
* Design **multi-region DR setup** with Object Storage replication.
* Apply **Health checks** and **failover policies**.

---

## üßÆ **8. Performance & Cost Optimization**

**Q:** How do you manage cost in OCI?
**A:**

* Use **cost-tracking tags** and budgets.
* Regularly review **usage reports**.
* Implement **auto-shutdown policies** for non-prod.
* Optimize instance shapes and block storage performance tiers.

---

## üß™ **9. Troubleshooting & Best Practices**

**Q:** How do you debug failed Terraform apply or CI/CD jobs?
**A:**

* Check pipeline logs for provider authentication issues.
* Run `TF_LOG=DEBUG` for verbose output.
* Validate provider versions.
* Ensure network/firewall rules allow access to OCI APIs.
* Re-run plan after drift correction.

---

## üí¨ **10. Behavioral/Scenario-Based**

**Q:** Describe a situation where you automated a deployment to improve reliability.
**A:**
At a financial client, we automated the deployment of microservices to OCI using GitLab CI/CD and Terraform. Previously, deployments required manual approval and had frequent configuration drift. With pipeline automation, each change triggered validation, plan, and apply stages with approval gates. This reduced errors and improved deployment frequency by 70%.

---

**Q:** How do you stay updated with OCI and DevOps trends?
**A:**

* Follow Oracle Cloud blogs and release notes.
* Participate in **OCI Cloud Developer Community**.
* Experiment with **Terraform Registry modules**.
* Take **OCI certification updates**.
