**A:**

* Store sensitive variables in environment variables or OCI Vault.
* Use `sensitive = true` in variable blocks.
* Use GitLab CI/CD secret masking for pipeline variables.

---

**Q9.** How can Terraform integrate with CI/CD (GitLab)?
**A:**

* Use GitLab runners to trigger Terraform jobs.
* Stages: **Validate ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Apply ‚Üí Destroy**.
