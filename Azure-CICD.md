## ‚úÖ DevOps & SRE

**Q1. What is SRE and how is it different from traditional Ops?**  
**A:** SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) focuses on applying software engineering principles to operations. It emphasizes reliability, observability, and automation. Traditional Ops manages infrastructure and support without a strong engineering mindset.

**Q2. What is an SLO, SLI, and SLA?**  
**A:**
- **SLA (Agreement)**: Commitment to customers (e.g., 99.9% uptime)
- **SLO (Objective)**: Internal reliability goal (e.g., 99.95%)
- **SLI (Indicator)**: Metric used (e.g., error rate, latency)

**Q3. How do you manage incidents in production?**  
**A:** Use runbooks, define severity levels, assign on-call, utilize tools like PagerDuty/ServiceNow, postmortem analysis, and track MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery).

**Q4. How do you measure availability?**  
**A:** `(Total time - Downtime) / Total time`. Also tracked via SLIs like success rate, latency, and uptime monitoring.

**Q5. Explain the concept of ‚ÄúError Budget‚Äù.**  
**A:** It's the acceptable amount of failure allowed. For 99.9% SLO, the error budget is 0.1%. If used up, feature releases pause to focus on stability.

## üöÄ CI/CD & Release Engineering

**Q6. What‚Äôs the difference between Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment?**  
**A:**
- **CI**: Frequent integration, unit tests
- **CD (Delivery)**: Code ready for deployment
- **CD (Deployment)**: Auto-deployment to production

**Q7. What tools do you use for CI/CD?**  
**A:** GitLab CI/CD, Azure DevOps Pipelines, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Spinnaker.

**Q8. How do you implement canary deployments?**  
**A:** Route a small percentage of traffic to the new version, monitor metrics, then gradually shift more traffic if no issues.

**Q9. What is Blue/Green Deployment?**  
**A:** Maintain two environments. Blue = Live. Green = New version. Switch traffic to Green after successful testing.

**Q10. How do you manage secrets in pipelines?**  
**A:** Use vaults or secure store (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault), environment variables with RBAC, encrypted values.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Platforms

**Q11. Explain the Shared Responsibility Model in cloud.**  
**A:** Cloud provider secures the infrastructure; the customer is responsible for data, identity, and workloads.

**Q12. Difference between AWS EC2 and Azure VM?**  
**A:** Functionally similar IaaS services. Differ in pricing, integrations, and surrounding ecosystem (e.g., IAM, monitoring).

**Q13. What are GCP VPC Service Controls?**  
**A:** GCP‚Äôs perimeter security model that protects data from exfiltration across project boundaries.

**Q14. What is Azure Availability Set vs Availability Zone?**  
**A:** Availability Sets distribute VMs across fault and update domains. Zones distribute VMs across physical locations.

**Q15. What is IAM and how do you manage access in cloud?**  
**A:** IAM = Identity & Access Management. Use roles, policies, groups, least privilege, service accounts.

## üß± Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

**Q16. What is Terraform and how does it work?**  
**A:** Terraform is an IaC tool that uses HCL to define infrastructure. It creates an execution plan, applies changes, and maintains state.

**Q17. What are Terraform modules?**  
**A:** Reusable blocks of configuration to create logical units. Helps with DRY code.

**Q18. How do you manage Terraform state securely?**  
**A:** Use remote backends (S3 with DynamoDB locking, Azure Storage with blob locking, GCS). Enable state encryption.

**Q19. What are `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`?**  
**A:**
- `plan`: Shows what will change
- `apply`: Executes changes

**Q20. How do you manage multiple environments in Terraform?**  
**A:** Use workspaces, separate state files, and parameterize variables for dev/stage/prod.

---

## üê≥ Containers & Kubernetes

**Q21. What is a Kubernetes Pod?**  
**A:** The smallest unit in K8s, encapsulates one or more containers with shared storage/network.

**Q22. What‚Äôs the difference between Deployment and StatefulSet?**  
**A:** Deployment = stateless apps. StatefulSet = apps with persistent identity (e.g., databases).

**Q23. How does a Kubernetes service work?**  
**A:** Provides stable networking for a set of pods via ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer.

**Q24. How do you secure communication between services in K8s?**  
**A:** Use MTLS via Istio/Linkerd, RBAC policies, Network Policies.

**Q25. What are Helm charts?**  
**A:** Templated Kubernetes YAMLs packaged into a chart for versioning and reuse.

---

## üìä Monitoring & Logging

**Q26. What tools do you use for monitoring?**  
**A:** Prometheus, Grafana, AppDynamics, New Relic, Azure Monitor, Datadog.

**Q27. What is an APM tool and why is it used?**  
**A:** Application Performance Monitoring tools (e.g., AppDynamics, Dynatrace) provide real-time insights into application performance.

**Q28. How do you set up logging for microservices?**  
**A:** Centralized logging using ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Fluentd + Cloud Logging.

**Q29. What is observability?**  
**A:** Beyond monitoring: understanding internal state from logs, metrics, traces. 3 pillars: Logging, Metrics, Traces.

**Q30. What is the difference between proactive and reactive monitoring?**  
**A:** Proactive = alerts before impact. Reactive = after issue is reported.

---

## üîê Security & Networking

**Q31. What is Zero Trust Architecture?**  
**A:** Never trust, always verify. Authenticate/authorize every user/device at every step.

**A:** Kubernetes Secrets (base64), External Secrets, Vault, encryption at rest, RBAC.

**Q33. What is the purpose of a service mesh?**  
**A:** Adds observability, traffic control, and security (e.g., Istio) to microservices without code changes.

**Q34. What is VPC peering?**  
**A:** Connecting two VPCs for internal communication using private IPs.
