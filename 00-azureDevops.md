You use the **`azurerm_policy_definition`** resource to define the policy and **`azurerm_policy_assignment`** to apply it.

Example:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_policy_definition" "require_tags" {
  name         = "require-tags"
  policy_type  = "Custom"
  mode         = "All"
  display_name = "Require specific tags"
  policy_rule  = file("${path.module}/policies/require_tags.json")
}

resource "azurerm_policy_assignment" "assign_require_tags" {
  name                 = "require-tags-assignment"
  policy_definition_id = azurerm_policy_definition.require_tags.id
  scope                = data.azurerm_subscription.primary.id
  description          = "Ensure all resources have specific tags"
}
```

---

### **3. How do you deploy Azure Policy Initiatives using Terraform?**

**Answer:**
Use the **`azurerm_policy_set_definition`** resource to combine multiple policies into an initiative.

    storage_account_name = var.state_storage
    container_name       = var.state_container
    key                  = "${terraform.workspace}.tfstate"
  }
  ```
* Use **Azure Lighthouse** or **Service Principal per tenant** for cross-tenant deployments.

---

### **6. How do you use Terraform with Azure Policy remediation tasks?**

**Answer:**
Terraform can **define policies** that include the **DeployIfNotExists** effect, but remediation is triggered from Azure side.
However, you can automate remediation setup using Terraform:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_policy_remediation" "example" {
  name                 = "remediate-vm-backup"
  scope                = data.azurerm_subscription.primary.id
  policy_assignment_id = azurerm_policy_assignment.backup_policy.id
}
```

This ensures remediation tasks are deployed automatically post-policy assignment.

---

### **7. How do you ensure Terraform deployments are idempotent for Azure Policy resources?**

**Answer:**

* Avoid hardcoding IDs ‚Äî always **reference resource IDs** dynamically.
* Use **lifecycle blocks** to prevent unnecessary re-creation:

  ```hcl
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [display_name]
  }
  ```
* Maintain **consistent names** and **resource identifiers** across environments.
* Store outputs in remote state for reusability.

---

  name                 = "require-environment-tag"
  scope                = data.azurerm_subscription.primary.id
  policy_definition_id = azurerm_policy_definition.require_tag.id
  parameters = jsonencode({
    tagName  = { value = "Environment" }
    tagValue = { value = "Production" }
  })
}
```

---

### **9. How do you integrate Terraform deployment with Azure DevOps pipelines?**

**Answer:**

1. **Store Terraform code** in Azure Repos or GitHub.
2. Use pipeline YAML like:

   ```yaml

  ```hcl
  variable "env" {}
  variable "resource_type" {}
  output "name" {
    value = "app-${var.env}-${var.resource_type}"
  }
  ```
* Combine both: Terraform ensures naming during deployment; Policy ensures compliance for external resources.

---

### **11. How do you handle drift detection between Terraform and Azure?**

**Answer:**

* Run `terraform plan` regularly (scheduled in CI/CD) to detect drift.
* Use **Azure Policy compliance reports** to identify out-of-band changes.

    policy/
      main.tf
      variables.tf
      outputs.tf
  ```
* Inputs include `definition_file`, `scope`, `parameters`, etc.
* Use versioned modules via private registry or Azure DevOps artifacts:

  ```
  module "policy_baseline" {
    source = "git::https://dev.azure.com/org/policies//modules/policy?ref=v1.2.0"
    scope  = data.azurerm_management_group.corp.id
  }
  ```

---

### **15. How do you ensure Terraform applies do not unintentionally overwrite policies created by other teams?**

**Answer:**

* Use **naming conventions** or **tags** (`owner: governance-team`).
* Scope Terraform deployment to **specific management groups or subscriptions**.
* Use **data sources** to read existing policies instead of recreating:

  ```hcl
  data "azurerm_policy_definition" "existing" {
